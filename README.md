# GAME--Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game---Visual-studio(USING C++)
Discripstion this code\
This C++ program implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game where the user chooses one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors, represented by the numbers 1, 2, or 3, respectively.
The computer's choice is randomly generated using the rand() function seeded with the current time to ensure randomness.
The program then compares the user's choice with the computer's choice and determines the winner or if it's a tie.
It also includes input validation to ensure that the user's input is within the valid range (0-2).
Compile and run this code in a C++ development environment to play the game.

1)	Enter the name of the game and show the entered name.
*This part of the code allows you to input the first name and last name, and this part of the code enables re-displaying of the input name. There you can find out who the computer player is and in this stage the client will have to show their own name at the end of the match.
